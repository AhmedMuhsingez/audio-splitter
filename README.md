#### So far, this project consists of two main functions:

1.  #### Numerical File Name fixes: This is helpful if you want to add or subtract numbers from your files' names in batch. E.g: your files names start from `1000.something` up to `1500.something`, using this function can help you remove/add numbers from the file name.

    All you have to do is to add the files to the “**in**” folder in the root of the project. After that, type node fileName.js in the terminal, and answer the follow-up prompts that will show:

    1\. If you need addition or subtraction

    2\. The amount of addition or subtraction

2.  #### Audio Splitting: This feature splits an audio file containing smaller audio pieces into separate audio files.

    You will need to set the first file name (numerically,) and add the files to the “**in**” folder in the root. The output will be inside a folder created in the root of the project.
